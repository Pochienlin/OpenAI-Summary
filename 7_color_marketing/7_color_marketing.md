- To find associated words on six major colors and relationships among colors, social network data sets are collected and analyzed with the techniques of text mining, association analysis, and data visualization.
- A survey on people’s perception on six colors are also conducted and analyzed.2.2 Network analysis of textual data on colors and applications
- Network analysis of textual data on colors and applications are performed to find the best color for an application such as advertisement on travel and insurance companies as examples.3. Findings
- This study shows that each color has associated words, and colors are associated together.
- The color concepts can be represented with colors and their associated words graphically.
