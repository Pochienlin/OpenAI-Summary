- European Journal of Political Economy (2013) analyzed the location choices of investors from emerging economies, with an emphasis on institutions and natural resources 
- A novel dataset of bilateral FDI flows was used 
- Results show that FDI from the South has a more regional aspect than investment from the North 
- Institutional distance has an asymmetric effect on FDI depending on whether investors choose countries with better or worse institutions 
- Large institutional distance discourages FDI inflows in the latter case, but this is diminished for destination countries with substantial resources 
- A complementary relationship between capital flows from the North and the South in developing recipient countries is also observed 
- This is attributed to different FDI patterns of these investors/n

*Bullet Points:
- Constructed a novel dataset to combine information on bilateral FDI flows
- Investigated whether investors from the South invest differently from their Northern counterparts
- Investigated the consequences of Southern FDI for North investors in terms of substitution or complementarity
- Found that South investors give preference to larger positive institutional distance when investing in countries with better institutions
- Found that the attractiveness of the primary sector diminishes the deterring effects of worse institutions for South investors
- Found that common language or same country in the past are of greater importance for South investors
- Confirmed that investors from the South may have a comparative advantage to invest in other developing countries
- Showed that more insight can be gained when differentiating between flows to countries with better and with worse institutions
- Large investors from the South may be taking away potential investment opportunities from North investors/n

- Traditional literature has paid particular attention to the importance of institutions in attracting FDI, as good economic institutions, such as property rights and rule of law, increase incentives to invest and lead to higher growth prospects. 
- Poor institutional environment, such as corruption or criminality, brings additional costs to FDI. 
- Institutional distance between origin and destination countries can impact FDI, with a larger institutional distance deterring investors.
- Studies have found that investors from countries with high corruption and a lack of enforcement of anticorruption laws select similar countries when they internationalize due to their familiarity with corrupt environments and lower costs of operation. 
- Good governance in host countries may even deter those investors who had previous negative experience at home. 
- Chinese investors often prefer countries with higher political risk, due to state-owned firms that do not maximize profits or close political ties between China and other developing host countries./n

- South-South FDI is driven by investors looking for natural resources and institutions in destination countries that are better than at home
- It is important to note that previous papers rely on a measure of institutional distance that assumes better or worse institutions have a similar deterring effect
- This study relaxes this assumption by introducing the notions of positive (host institutions are better than home institutions) and negative institutional distance (host institutions are worse than home institutions)
- Studies have confirmed rent-seeking models, which show natural resources induce corruption in countries with non-democratic regimes
- Studies have shown that natural resources income is one of the leading determinants of the probability of wars and of conflict duration
- This close nexus between institutions and resources requires a simultaneous examination of the impact of institutions and endowment with natural resources
- It is unclear whether South investors enter into competition with investors from the North for new investment opportunities
- South investors may have advantages over developed countries when investing in the South, such as familiarity with low cost production processes and the use of technologies that are more appropriate for developing countries/n

- Tata, a company from India, used acquisitions to target Jaguar and Land Rover brands
- Firms from developed countries possess advantages based on ownership of key assets, such as technologies, brands and intellectual property, while developing country corporations rely more on advantages related to production process capabilities, networks and organizational structure
- No study has explored the potential substitution or complementarity between South-South FDI and the ability of developed economies to invest in the South
- Data for the study comes from OECD statistics, ASEAN, UNCTAD, World Bank Development Indicators, CEPII, Cohen and Soto, World Bank Natural Resources Wealth, and Kaufmann et al.
- Between 1996-2007 there was a considerable increase in the total amount of FDI inflows, almost doubling by the end of the period
- 63.4% of total FDI amount came from North to North, while South-South investments accounted for 14.5% and North-south FDI represented 18.4%
- 80% of FDI from the South was invested into the South, while 77% of FDI from the North was directed to the North/n

Summary:
- In 1996-2007, South-South FDI inflows were $96800 millions, representing 14.5% of total FDI inflows.
- North-North FDI inflows were $423000 millions, representing 63.4% of total FDI inflows.
- North-South FDI inflows were $123170 millions, representing 18.4% of total FDI inflows.
- South-North FDI inflows were $24500 millions, representing 3.7% of total FDI inflows.
- Positive (negative) institutional distance is equal to an absolute institutional difference between destination and origin countries when institutions at destination country are better (worse) than at home and zero otherwise.
- Panel B and C of Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the gravity-type sample split according to the investors' preferences of investing into countries with better, or worse, institutions than at home.
- Correlations between host resources and inflows differ depending on type of FDI and institutional distance./n

 ## PAGE 7


- 81% of South-South flows go to countries with worse institutions than at home
- North-North investors have lower institutional differences than South-South investors
- South-South flows with negative institutional distance have a positive correlation with FDI inflows
- South-South flows with positive institutional distance have a negative correlation with FDI inflows, although close to nil
- South and North investors invest into institutionally worse economies with resources 
- South and North countries investing into better South economies tend to have less resources
- 399 panel type country-year observations show significant portion of regional FDI from richer and larger neighbors/n

institutions.

**Summary:**
- To compare the investment behaviour of investors from the South and North, a gravity equation was used.
- Significant gravity variables had expected signs, and the difference in GDP per capita between origin and destination countries had no significant effect.
- The coefficient on the institutional distance in the gravity equation was interpreted as the impact of institutional distance on FDI outflows from the South, while the sum of this coefficient with the interaction coefficient was interpreted as the impact on FDI outflows from the North.
- Investors from the North prefer to invest in countries with similar institutions, while investors from the South invest in countries with either much better or much worse institutions.
- Disaggregating the absolute institutional distance into positive and negative institutional distance showed that when investors from the South invest in countries with better institutions, they are attracted by the best institutions, while when investors from the South invest in countries with poorer institutions than at home, they appear not to care about institutions./n

** Summarizing:

- Absolute institutional distance has a positive and statistically significant effect on FDI flows
- Market size, GDP difference, contiguity, common language, colonial links and smallness of the country were also found to have positive and statistically significant effect on FDI flows
- Omitting the availability of natural resources from the estimation can bias the results 
- When the availability of natural resources is controlled for, the coefficients on institutions change sign and significance 
- The results were found to be robust when the sample was split into South and North origin countries, and when the definition of resources was restricted to fossil fuels./n

** Summarize **

- South investors are attracted by better institutional environment while North investors are indifferent
- All investors are deterred by larger negative institutional distance
- South investors who invest in countries with worse institutions are less deterred by institutional distance when host countries are endowed with a large wealth of natural resources
- North investors are consistently deterred by worse institutions, despite the availability of resources in host countries/n

- South FDI behaves as a complement to North FDI
- Estimation results show that the total effect of a unit change in South FDI over GDP is greater than one
- This effect is evaluated at the mean value of natural resources and the 95% confidence interval is (1.994; 2.446)
- When country fixed effects are included, the total effect of a unit change in South FDI over GDP is still greater than one, with a 95% confidence interval of (1.367;1.705)/n

- Summary:
- M. Aleksynska and O. Havrylchyk studied the effect of South FDI on Total FDI in the European Journal of Political Economy (2013) 
- They used multiple regression analyses and the Blundell and Bond (1998) system GMM estimator to control for endogeneity of the variable of interest
- Results showed a long-term complementarity effect between South and North FDI of 2.372 to 3.375, indicating that South FDI has a positive effect on Total FDI/n

*Conclusion:
- South-South FDI is one-third of total foreign investment in developing and transition economies 
- South and North FDI have different determinants and implications 
- Institutional distance is a driving force when South invests in countries with better institutions 
- South FDI is deterred by the worst institutions 
- Natural resources endowment has an amplifying effect on the complementary relationship between South and North FDI
- South FDI is asset-seeking and encourages investment in countries with relatively similar and only marginally worse institutions 
- South and North FDI have a mutually reinforcing relationship/n
